		<h1>About XMLvis</h1>
		<div class="continuoustext">
			<p>
				<b class="grey">XMLvis</b> is a tool for visualising plays in the form of XML data of the corpora of the <a href="https://dracor.org/">DraCor</a> project. It offers different visualisation methods for different questions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				XMLvis is aimed primarily at people without a technical background who want to use the DraCor corpora, e.g. for literary analyses. For this reason, XMLvis contains many beginner-friendly explanatory texts that explain the plots, the tables and their contents in detail and are intended to help with the selection of options. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But this tool can also be useful for Data Scientists, Data Analysts, Digital Humanities scholars, NLP enthusiasts and similar professions and fields from the IT-field: Should one want to use the DraCor corpus for one's research, XMLvis takes care of the first step of a typical workflow, the <b class="lightgrey">"insight into the corpus"</b>, without having to access external libraries. The statistics, the presentation of word frequencies as tables and distributions, the word clouds, the trend plots as well as the KWIC tables give a good first impression of the selected corpus and show its possibilities and its limitations.
			</p>
			<p>	
				It should be noted that XMLvis was only designed for a first insight or some specific questions. For more possibilities and further analysis, further tools are recommended. <a href="http://voyant-tools.org/">Voyant Tools</a>, for example, provides even more methods for analysing corpora and making them visually accessible.
