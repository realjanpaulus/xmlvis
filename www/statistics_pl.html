		<h3>How to use the play length plot</h3>
		<div class="continuoustext">
			<p>
				The <b class="grey">play lengths comparison plot</b> is an extension of the <i>overall word count</i> and <i>unique word count</i> of the overview table. Using the option <i>Select word count method</i> in the left panel, you can select whether the length of a play is to be calculated using the "token" or "type" count. The plot can only be generated for at least two selected plays of an author, which is why the selection <i>Select multiple plays</i> is automatically activated with two pre-selected plays. For authors with only one play in the corpus or only one selected play, no plot is generated. In the plot, the selected plays of the author are plotted on the x-axis and the selected Token/Type count is plotted on the y-axis. Images of the play lengths plots can be saved on the computer with a right click on the plot and choosing the option <i>"Save Image As..."</i> (or a similar option, depending on the browser used).
			</p>
			<p>
				In the left panel, more options can be selected:
				<ul>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Select a visualization method</b>: Selection of the visualization method ("Line plot" or "Bar chart").</li>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Use a linebreak in the title of the plot</b>: If selected, the name of the author in the title will be moved to the next line.</li>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Plot title size</b>: The title of the plot can be enlarged or reduced with this option.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</div>

			<div class="continuoustext">	
				<u>Note</u>: For authors with multiple plays, it may take a short time to calculate the plot for the selected plays by that author.
