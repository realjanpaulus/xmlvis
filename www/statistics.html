		<h3>How to use</h3>
		<div class="continuoustext">
			<p>
				Some <b class="grey">statistics</b> about a play or all plays of an author are calculated here. For the latter, the checkbox <i>"Use all plays"</i> must be selected in the panel on the left. Options such as <i>stop word consideration</i>, <i>punctuation removal</i> and <i>lowercase conversion of words</i> can be selected in the left panel. Special statistics options such as the <i>Measure for the lexical diversity</i> option can also be found there.
			</p>
			<p>
				The tables different statistics are now explained in more detail:
				<ul>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Overall word count of all plays (= <u>token</u> count)</b>: Counts all individual words (= <b class="lightgrey">tokens</b>) of a play or all plays. Duplicate words are distinguished. <u>Example</u>: The sentence "and I waited and waited" consists of 5 tokens ("and", "I", "waited", "and", "waited").</li>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Unique word count of all plays (= <u>type</u> count)</b>: Counts all unique words (= <b class="lightgrey">types</b>) of a play or all plays. Duplicate words are not distinguished. <u>Example</u>: The sentence "and I waited and waited" consists of 3 types ("and", "I", "waited").</li>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Proportion of stop words in the play/all plays</b>: Proportion of stop words in the entire text (= single play or all plays). Is not influenced by the option <i>Remove stopwords</i>.</li>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Count of sentences in the play/all plays</b>: Count of sentences or sentence-like separation units in the entire text (= single play or all plays). This count should be considered as an approximate reference count rather than a definitive count.</li>
					
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Count of numbers in the play/all plays</b>: Count of numeric tokens (e.g. years) in the entire text (= single play or all plays).</li>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Lexical diversity in the play/all plays</b>: Calculates the lexical diversity (or lexical richness) of the text (= single play or all plays) using the specified measure. By default, "TTR: Token-Type Ratio" is selected. This is calculated by dividing the number of types by the number of tokens. Further measures can be selected on the left using the <i>Measure for the lexical diversity</i> option. How these are calculated and further informations can be found in this <a href="https://quanteda.io/reference/textstat_lexdiv.html" target="_blank">article</a>.</li>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Text readability of the play/all plays</b>: Calculates the readability of a text (= single play or all plays). The measure attempts to quantify how hard a text is to read. Measures can be selected on the left using the <i>Measure for the text readability:</i> option. The scores for the various measure differs and have their own meaning in their respective context. For example, if the popular measure "Flesch" is selected, a higher score indicates that the text is easier to read, a lower score indicates that the text is more difficult to read. Instructions on how the different measures are calculated and further informations can be found in this <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/quanteda/versions/2.1.2/topics/textstat_readability" target="_blank">article</a>.</li>
