		<h3>What is a word frequency table?</h3>
		<div class="continuoustext">
			<p>
				A <b class="grey">word frequency table</b> represents the most frequent words, their frequency and their document frequency in a descending order.
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<h3>How to use</h3>
		<div class="continuoustext">
			<p>
				The <b class="grey">word frequencies</b> of a play or selected plays of an author are calculated here. For the latter, the checkbox <i>Select multiple plays</i> must be selected in the panel on the left. The word frequencies of a play/selected plays of an author are represented on the left in the form of a <b class="grey">table</b>. General options such as <i>stop word consideration</i>, <i>punctuation removal</i> and <i>lowercase conversion of words</i> can be selected in the left panel.
			</p>
			<p>
				The table is sorted by the most frequent words. You can sort the table by its <b class="grey">feature names (= unique words)</b>, the <b class="grey">most/less frequent words</b> and the <b class="grey">document frequency</b> by clicking on the column names.
				<ul>
					<li><b class="grey">feature</b>: Name of the target word.</li>
					<li><b class="grey">frequency</b>: The values in the column <b class="grey">frequency</b> describe the <i>absolute frequencies</i> or the <i>relative frequencies</i> of the word, if the corresponding entry in the left panel <i>Select frequency methods</i> of the <i>Word frequencies options</i> is selected. If <i>Absolute Frequencies</i> is chosen, the simple counts of the words within the play will be used. If <i>Relative Frequencies</i> is chosen, the proportion of word frequencies in relation to the total number of words within the play or selected play will be used. <u>Note</u>: If multiple plays are selected, the total number of words in the <u>combined</u> plays is used for the <i>Relative frequencies</i>.</li>
					<li><b class="grey">docfreq</b>: The values in the column <b class="grey">docfreq</b> describe how often the words occur in a document (= <i>document frequency</i> (DF)). A word occurs at least in one document and at most in all documents.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				It is possible to search for specific column values in the table using the search masks under the respective column names or for values in the whole table using the search bar at the top. <i>Show n entries</i> can be used to increase the number of table entries per page. Below the table, information on all entries is given and a page turning function is provided.
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			<div class="continuoustext">	
				<u>Note</u>: For authors with multiple plays, it may take a short time to calculate all word frequencies for the selected plays by that author.
