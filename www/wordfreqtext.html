		<h3>What is a word frequency table and distribution?</h3>
		<div class="continuoustext">
			<p>
				A <b class="grey">word frequency table</b> represents the most frequent words, their frequency and their document frequency in a descending order.
			</p>
			<p>
				A <b class="grey">word frequency production</b> is based on the word frequency table, but represents the most frequent words in a plot. The plot can be displayed in different ways, here a one-dimensional scatter plot (also called dot plot). The x-axis of the plot represents the different features, the y-axis the frequency. In most cases, the distribution will resemble <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law">Zipf's distribution</a>.
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<h3>How to use</h3>
		<div class="continuoustext">
			<p>
				The <b class="grey">word frequencies</b> of a play or all plays of an author are calculated here. For the latter, the checkbox <i>"Use all plays"</i> must be selected in the panel on the left. The word frequencies of a play/all plays of an author are represented on the left in the form of a <b class="grey">table</b>. Options such as <i>stop word consideration</i>, <i>punctuation removal</i> and <i>lowercase conversion of words</i> can be selected in the left panel.
			</p>
			<p>
				The table is sorted by the most frequent words. You can sort the table by its <b class="grey">feature names (= unique words)</b>, the <b class="grey">most/less frequent words</b> and the <b class="grey">document frequency</b> by clicking on the column names. The values in the column <i>"frequency"</i> describe the <b class="grey">absolute frequencies</b> of the word. The values in the column <b class="grey">"docfreq"</b> describe how often the words occur in a document (= document frequency (DF)). A word occurs at least in one document and at most in all documents.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is possible to search for specific column values in the table using the search masks under the respective column names or for values in the whole table using the search bar at the top. <i>"Show n entries"</i> can be used to increase the number of table entries per page. Below the table, information on all entries is given and a page turning function is provided.
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			<div class="continuoustext">	
				<u>Note</u>: For authors with multiple plays, it may take a short time to calculate all word frequencies for all plays by that author.
