		<h3>What is a word frequency distribution?</h3>
		<div class="continuoustext">
			<p>
				A <b class="grey">word frequency distribution</b> is based on the word frequency table, but represents the most frequent words in a plot and not in a table. The plot can be displayed in different ways, here a one-dimensional scatter plot (also called dot plot). The x-axis of the plot represents the different features, the y-axis the frequency. In most cases, the distribution will resemble <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law">Zipf's distribution</a>.

		<h3>How to use</h3>
		<div class="continuoustext">
			<p>
				The <b class="grey">word frequencies</b> of a play or selected plays of an author are calculated here. For the latter, the checkbox <i>Select multiple plays</i> must be selected in the panel on the left. The word frequencies of a play/selected plays of an author are represented on the left in the form of a <b class="grey">distribution</b>. General options such as <i>stop word consideration</i>, <i>punctuation removal</i> and <i>lowercase conversion of words</i> can be selected in the left panel.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h4><u>Word frequencies options</u></h4>
				On the left panel are a number of <b class="grey">Word frequencies options</b>:
				<ul>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Revert the order of the frequencies</b>: If activated, the word frequencies will be sorted in ascending order.</li>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Top n frequent features</b>: Selects how many of the top frequent features should be plotted in the distribution.</li>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Select frequency method</b>: There are two options: <i>Relative Frequencies</i> and <i>Absolute Frequencies</i>. If <i>Absolute Frequencies</i> is chosen, the simple counts of the words within the play will be used. If <i>Relative Frequencies</i> is chosen, the proportion of word frequencies in relation to the total number of words within the play or selected play will be used. <u>Note</u>: If multiple plays are selected, the total number of words in the <u>combined</u> plays is used for the <i>Relative frequencies</i>.</li>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Use a linebreak in the title of the plot</b>: If selected, the name of the author in the title will be moved to the next line.</li>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Plot title size</b>: The title of the plot can be enlarged or reduced with this option.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			<div class="continuoustext">	
				<u>Note</u>: For authors with multiple plays, it may take a short time to calculate all word frequencies and the respective distribution for the selected plays by that author.
