		<h3>How to use the lexical diversity plot</h3>
		<div class="continuoustext">
			<p>
				The <b class="grey">lexical diversity plot</b> is an extension of the <i>lexical diversity measure</i> of the overview table. The measure can be selected on the left using the <i>Measure for the lexical diversity</i> option. How these measures are calculated and further informations can be found in this <a href="https://quanteda.io/reference/textstat_lexdiv.html" target="_blank">article</a>. The plot can only be generated for at least two selected plays of an author, which is why the selection <i>Select multiple plays</i> is automatically activated. In the plot, all plays of the author are plotted on the x-axis and the selected lexical diversity measure is plotted on the y-axis. For authors with only one play in the corpus or only one selected play, no plot is generated. Images of the lexical diversity plots can be saved on the computer with a right click on the plot and choosing the option <i>"Save Image As..."</i> (or a similar option, depending on the browser used).
			</p>
			<p>
				In the left panel, more options can be selected:
				<ul>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Select a visualization method</b>: Selection of the visualization method ("Line plot" or "bar chart").</li>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Use a linebreak in the title of the plot</b>: If selected, the name of the author in the title will be moved to the next line.</li>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Plot title size</b>: The title of the plot can be enlarged or reduced with this option.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

				<u>Note</u>: For authors with multiple plays, it may take a short time to calculate the plot for the selected plays by that author.
