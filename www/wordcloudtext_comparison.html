		<h3>How to use the wordcloud comparison</h3>
			<div class="continuoustext">
				<p>
					The <b class="grey">comparison wordcloud</b> is a composite wordcloud of selected plays by the author which can be then compared and contrasted. The maximum frequency will be split evenly across the plays. The selection <i>Select multiple plays</i> is deactivated, the plays must be selected by hand. By default, the first two plays are selected. If only one or no play is selected or the author has only one play in the corpus, no comparison wordcloud is plotted. For computional reasons, only a maximum of 8 plays can be selected, even if the <i>Select all</i> button is pressed and the author has more than 8 plays in the corpus. Then the <u>first</u> 8 plays of the play selection list are plotted. In addition to to the already existing options, another wordcloud option panel appears on the left side: the <b class="grey">Wordcloud comparsion options</b>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The new panel options are:
					<ul>
						<li><b class="lightgrey">Size of the play names</b>: This specifies the size of the play names within the comparison wordcloud.</li>
						<li><b class="lightgrey">Padding of the play names</b>: This specifies the spacing between the play names and the actual wordcloud.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>
			<div class="continuoustext">	
				<u>Notes</u>: 
				<ul>
					<li>It is recommended not to compare more than four plays at a time, as this can quickly become too confusing and chaotic.</li>
					<li>For authors with multiple plays, it may take a short time to calculate the wordclouds.</li>
				</ul>
