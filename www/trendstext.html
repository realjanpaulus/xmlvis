		<h3>What is Trends?</h3>
		<div class="continuoustext">
			<p>
				<b class="grey">Trends</b> is a visualization method that represents the frequencies of a target word across segments of a text or across texts in a corpus. The x-axis of the plot represents the segments or the texts and the y-axis represents the frequency (absolute or relative frequency). It is similar to the "classic" word frequencies plot, except that here only one word is in the focus and not all words of a text.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h3>How to use</h3>
		<div class="continuoustext">
			<p>
				The <b class="grey">Trends</b> graph of segments of a play or of selected plays is plotted here.  For the latter, the checkbox <i>Select multiple plays</i> must be selected in the panel on the left. Then a graph is plotted, which shows the frequency of the target word in the selected plays. <u>Note</u>: If only one play or an author with only one play in the corpus is selected in the multiple plays selection, no plot is generated. When a single play is selected (and <i>Select multiple plays</i> is deactivated), that play is divided into segments and the plot shows the frequency of the target word within the segments instead. Depending on the selection, various options are available (see below). General options such as <i>stop word consideration</i>, <i>punctuation removal</i> and <i>lowercase conversion of words</i> can be selected in the left panel. Images of the trends plots can be saved on the computer with a right click on the plot and choosing the option <i>"Save Image As..."</i> (or a similar option, depending on the browser used).
			</p>
			<p>
				<h4><u>Trend options</u></h4>
				On the left panel are a number of <b class="grey">Trends options</b>:
				<ul>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Number of segments</b> (only for single play): Indicates the plotted number of segments. Only has an effect when only one play is selected and <i>Select multiple plays</i> is deactivated.</li>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Select frequency method</b>: There are two options: <i>Relative Frequencies</i> and <i>Absolute Frequencies</i>. If <i>Absolute Frequencies</i> is chosen, the simple counts of the words within the play will be used. If <i>Relative Frequencies</i> is chosen, the proportion of word frequencies in relation to the total number of words within the play or selected play will be used. <u>Note</u>: If multiple plays are selected, the total number of words in the <u>combined</u> plays is used for the <i>Relative frequencies</i>.</li>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Select frequency method</b>: Sorting of the available keywords by an <i>alphabetical</i> order or by the <i>most frequent words</i> in descending order according to the largest frequency, shown in parantheses behind the word.</li>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Select the target word</b>: Selection for the target word.</li>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Use a linebreak in the title of the plot</b>: If selected, the name of the author in the title will be moved to the next line.</li>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Plot title size</b>: The title of the plot can be enlarged or reduced with this option.</li>
				</ul>

				<u>Note</u>: For authors with multiple plays, it may take a short time to calculate the plot.
