		<h3>What is a wordcloud?</h3>
		<div class="continuoustext">
			A <b class="grey">wordcloud</b> represents the <b class="lightgrey">most frequent words</b> within a text in some kind of "cloud". The words are displayed in proportion to their frequency within the text: The more frequently a word occurs, the <u>larger</u> it is. In addition, the more frequently occurring words have stronger, more dominant colours, the less frequently occurring words have rather paler shades. 
		</div>
		<h3>How to use the simple wordcloud</h3>
		<div class="continuoustext">
			<p>
				(Simple) <b class="grey">wordclouds</b> for the play or selected plays of an author are calculated here. For the latter, the checkbox <i>Select multiple plays</i> must be selected in the panel on the left. Options such as <i>stop word consideration</i>, <i>punctuation removal</i> and <i>lowercase conversion of words</i> are in the left panel. Images of the wordclouds can be saved on the computer with a right click on the wordcloud and choosing the option <i>"Save Image As..."</i> (or a similar option, depending on the browser used).
			</p>
			<p>
				<h4><u>Wordcloud options</u></h4>
				On the left panel are a number of <b class="grey">wordcloud options</b>:
				<ul>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Minimum frequency</b>: This specifies the minimum number of times a word must occur in the text for it to appear in the wordcloud. If this value is set very low, almost all unique words in the text will be considered for the wordcloud plot, which may result in not all words being displayed due to the limited space in the wordcloud.</li>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Maximum number of words</b>: This indicates the maximum number of words that will be plotted. The least frequently occurring words are discarded. </li>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Word padding</b>: This specifies how large the spacing between the words (= padding space) of the wordcloud should be.</li>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Size</b>: This specifies how large the wordcloud should be.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</div>

			<div class="continuoustext">	
				<u>Note</u>: For authors with multiple plays, it may take a short time to calculate the wordclouds.
