		<h3>What is a wordcloud?</h3>
		<div class="continuoustext">
			A <b class="grey">wordcloud</b> represents the <b class="lightgrey">most frequent words</b> within a text in some kind of "cloud". The words are displayed in proportion to their frequency within the text: The more frequently a word occurs, the larger it is. In addition, the more frequently occurring words have stronger, more dominant colours, the less frequently occurring words have rather paler shades. 
		</div>
		<h3>How to use</h3>
		<div class="continuoustext">
			<p>
				<b class="grey">Wordclouds</b> for the play of an author or for all of his plays and a comparison wordcloud for all of the authors plays are calculated here. 
				For the last two, the checkbox <i>"Use all plays"</i> must be selected in the panel on the left. Options such as <i>stop word consideration</i>, <i>punctuation removal</i> and <i>lowercase conversion of words</i> are in the lower left panel. Images of the wordclouds can be saved on the computer with a right click on the wordcloud and choosing the option <i>"Save Image As..."</i> (or a similar option, depending on the browser used).
			</p>
			<p>
				<h4><u>Wordcloud options</u></h4>
				On the left panel are a number of <b class="grey">wordcloud options</b>:
				<ul>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Minimum frequency</b>: This specifies the minimum number of times a word must occur in the text for it to appear in the word cloud. If this value is set very low, almost all unique words in the text will be considered for the wordcloud plot, which may result in not all words being displayed due to the limited space in the wordcloud.</li>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Maximum number of words</b>: This indicates the maximum number of words that will be plotted. The least frequently occurring words are discarded. </li>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Word padding</b>: This specifies how large the spacing between the words (= padding space) of the wordcloud should be.</li>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Size</b>: This specifies how large the word cloud should be.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h4><u>Wordcloud comparison options</u></h4>
				When the checkbox <i>"Use all plays"</i> is selected, another wordcloud option panel appears on the left side: the <b class="grey">Wordcloud comparsion options</b>. With this option, wordclouds can be created from all the plays of an author and these can be compared with each other. The maximum frequency will be split evenly across the authors. However, only the first eight pieces can be compared. In addition, no comparison wordcloud can be created from authors who are only represented with one play in the corpus; in this case, a standard wordcloud of all plays is plotted instead.<br>
				The new options are:
				<ul>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Size of the play names</b>: This specifies the size of the play names within the comparison wordcloud.</li>
					<li><b class="lightgrey">Padding of the play names</b>: This specifies the spacing between the play names and the actual wordcloud.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			<div class="continuoustext">	
				<u>Note</u>: For authors with multiple plays, it may take a short time to calculate the wordclouds.
